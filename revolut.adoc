= Payment methods: Revolut
 
== Description
 
Revolut Ltd is a digital banking alternative that includes a pre-paid debit card (MasterCard or VISA),
currency exchange, cryptocurrency exchange (Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC)) and
peer-to-peer payments. Revolut currently charges no fees for the majority of its services (but for a
capped usage), and uses interbank exchange rates for its currency exchange on weekdays, and charge a
markup from 0.5% to 1.5% on weekends. The Revolut App gives customers instant access to Bitcoin,
Litecoin and Ether by exchanging to/from 25 fiat currencies. However, they remain in the app and
cannot be moved to another cryptocurrency wallet.

== Best practices

When using phone number as a Revolut ID will automatically allow you to make an instant payment.
When using e-mail an e-mail is sent to the other user with an unconfirmed payment and they need to
claim it. UX is worse / privacy is better with e-mail.
